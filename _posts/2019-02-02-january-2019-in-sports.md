As the year counter ticked over from 2018 to to 2019 I kicked into motion my plan to get better at this sports thing. This mainly took the shape of doing a lot more exercise and trying to stick to my training plan as closely as I can.

Here&#8217;s some numbers from Training Peaks:

**Total time &#8211;** 40 hours 29 minutes  
**Total distance &#8211;** 726km

**Running time &#8211;** 9 hours 40 minutes  
**Running distance &#8211;** 93.4km

**Cycling time &#8211;** 20 hours 6 minutes  
**Cycling distance &#8211;** 620km

**Swim time &#8211;** 4 hours 37 minutes  
**Swim distance &#8211;** 11,845m

**Strength time &#8211;** 3 hours 15 minutes

Those are the biggest numbers I&#8217;ve ever done, which is pretty exciting. I still have three whole months of preparation for Ironman 70.3 Barcelona so I need to make sure I can keep this up.

Somethings I need to work on:

  * **Swim sessions &#8211;** I was pretty lax in doing them and sticking to the target distances
  * **Strength and injury prehab** **&#8211;** I have the time to expand these sessions
  * **Sleep &#8211;** I&#8217;m not getting in enough sleep. I should be aiming for over 8 hours a day
  * **Food &#8211;** I&#8217;m not regularly doing the meal prep I should be which means I am eating rubbish every now and then.
