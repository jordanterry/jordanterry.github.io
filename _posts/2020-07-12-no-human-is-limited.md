Eliud Kipchoge a few days before he ran a sub two hour marathon.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large">
  <p>
    Pressure is everywhere in this world, if you&#8217;re a human being. I&#8217;m trying to stay as calm as possible. It&#8217;s about telling people there is one who sets the limits. It&#8217;s only in their minds; it&#8217;s not something tangible, it&#8217;s just happening in their thoughts. I am just trying to remove that click in their minds that no human is limited.
