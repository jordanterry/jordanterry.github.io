Everyone has regrets or moments they wish they could redo. My big redo moment came sometime in the first two months of 2019.

To set the scene: I sat and worked alongside a contractor on our team for two months and we clashed. We had contrarian views on anything we talked about; I didn&#8217;t believe that was possible, but it is. We are both software engineers who write code. Our differences would often come to head in my code reviews. I&#8217;d disagree with an approach taken and it would often result in long, and very exhausting discussions.

One day it came to head, a disagreement on some code, some code so insignificant I can&#8217;t recall what it was. Whether it was the fatigue of long winding conversations to nowhere or just pent up frustration, I snapped. Saying something along the lines of &#8220;you aren&#8217;t writing good code, we are having to spend time correcting mistakes&#8221;.

I said this in an open office environment, surrounded by colleagues in our team. I apologised shortly after; even if the criticism I had leveled were founded in truth, no one deserves to be belittled or spoken to how I did.

That one moment of overflown anger has been on my mind for almost 18 months now. I constantly replayed the few minutes of disagreement in my head and over time my replays have transitioned from words to just how I felt.

I mostly felt: embarrassment and guilt.

**Embarrassment**, I think of myself as a calm person, I don&#8217;t yell or become frustrated at other people and it embarrassed me that I let it happen.

**Guilt**, it isn&#8217;t right to attempt to make someone feel bad for doing their job, a job at which they were trying at isn&#8217;t an acceptable way to treat someone.

Everyone _should_ know that treating another person poorly is one of the worst traits a human can exhibit. It isn&#8217;t hard to treat everyone you interact with decency. It makes me cringe to see people do the opposite and knowing I did that makes me cringe at the thought of it.

This small incident took up a lot of headspace for a while, but I&#8217;ve since used to to inform how I act towards other people.

If I ever find myself in a difficult relationship, I&#8217;ll always take a minute before replying; try to understand how we got into this situation and find an amicable way out of it. A sprinkle of humour helps too.

Some people will say that yelling and aggression toward other people is a way of asserting dominance. I disagree, it is embarrassing to witness or do. I think every interaction with another person forms a small part of how that person will remember you going forward. So, just be decent.
