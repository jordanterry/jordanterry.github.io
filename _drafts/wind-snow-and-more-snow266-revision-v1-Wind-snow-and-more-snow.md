Once again I have been defeated by the weather an another attempt to complete my qualifying cross country.

My first attempt on Wednesday was scuppered by forecast strong and gusty winds &#8211; that was a hard one to cancel as the sky was clear and the winds were calm. Luckily, the winds did get quite gusty which I think proved my decision right!

The second chance will be tomorrow, but as the UK is currently being battered by negative temperatures and snow from the beast from the east I think it will be very unlikely.

I think I will hold off flying until the end of April or the start of May in the hope of finding some nicer weather there. Iâ€™m under no time pressure to finish my PPL just yet and I would prefer to get some good flying done with nice weather.
