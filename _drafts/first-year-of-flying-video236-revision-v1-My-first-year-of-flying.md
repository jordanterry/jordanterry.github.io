As I am approaching the end of my first year of flying I thought it would be good to put together a short video from the footage I have taken over the year. 

It was nice to reminisce over my first few flying lessons with my Dad, then onto my first solo flights, then onto flying some aerobatics and then onto flying around the south coast all on my own! Iâ€™m still a rookie at video editing but I feel like this has come together quite well!
